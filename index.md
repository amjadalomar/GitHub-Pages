## About Me

My name is **Amjad Al-Omar**. I am a 4th year *Mathematics-Computer Science* student in Sixth college. I am interested in becoming a backend developer and focusing on infrastructure. If you wanna give me a job, let me know. I will accept. In my free time, I enjoy doing puzzles, playing board games, soccer, basketball, and watching anime. ~~I dont know what I'm doing.~~ I always know what I'm doing 100% of the time. :)

To be completely honest, `git checkout` confuses me so much. But I've learned that its related to `git branch`. 

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
